# ned

This is a stubbed-out command-line interface to [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) which I may or may not actually develop. NeDB provides a MongoDB-like querying interface for plain JSON in node.js. That same functionality on the command-line would make many a data munging operation a lot easier.

Something like Ned would complement nicely with [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) and [refract](https://github.com/stdbrouw/refract) as three really nice options to filter and transform JSON.
